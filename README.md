This folder contains the source code for the NC Innovation Center Project. 
It requires a web browser with flash player for the Google Motion APIs. 
The launch page is NC_Map.html.

Note: Flash visualizations will load only when accessed through a web server. They cannot be viewed from the local filesystem due to Flash player security settings. Visualizations in action can be viewed from: http://www4.ncsu.edu/~psavits/csc591/NC_Map.html
